## **Description:**

Make a single program in the C language by augmenting and integrating the example C code in Section 4.2 and 4.4.1 on the textbook. The program is supposed to read a text file line by line. For each line, it produces the output similar to what's shown on the textbook. If a syntax error is found, it should print an error message indicating where the error occurs in the line. The program should be invoked by the following command: 


                                parser *<filename>* 
                    Where, filename should be replaced by a real file name.

*Note: Here textbook refers to “Concepts Of Programming Languages” by Robert W. Sebesta.*
